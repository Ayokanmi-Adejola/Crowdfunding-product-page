## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive crowdfunding product page that allows users to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
-   Make a selection of which pledge to make.
-   See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge.
-   See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge.
-   Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked.


## Features

-   **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
-   **Interactive Elements**: Hover and active states for all interactive elements.
-   **Pledge Selection Modal**: A modal that allows users to select a pledge amount.
-   **Dynamic Updates**: The progress bar, total backed amount, and total backers update dynamically based on user pledges.
-   **Bookmark Functionality**: Users can bookmark the project, and the state is saved.
-   **Form Validation**: Basic validation on pledge inputs.

## My Process

### Built With

-   **Semantic HTML5 markup**: For better accessibility and SEO.
-   **CSS Custom Properties**: For maintainable and scalable styling.
-   **Flexbox & CSS Grid**: For modern and responsive layouts.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript**: For all the interactive functionality.
-   **Mobile-first workflow**: Starting with mobile styles and scaling up to desktop.

### What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice and solidify my skills in front-end development. Some key takeaways include:

-   **Advanced CSS Layouts**: I gained more experience with Flexbox and Grid to create complex, responsive layouts that match the design precisely.
-   **DOM Manipulation with JavaScript**: I implemented the interactive features by manipulating the DOM with vanilla JavaScript, including showing/hiding modals, updating content dynamically, and handling user input.
-   **State Management**: I managed the application state (like pledge amounts, backers, and bookmarked status) within JavaScript, which was a good exercise in handling data on the client-side.

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to:

-   Refactor the JavaScript to be more modular and organized, possibly using ES6 modules.
-   Add more robust form validation with clearer error messages.
-   Implement saving the bookmarked state and pledge data to `localStorage` so it persists between sessions.
